\section{Introduction}

The First Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and
Experiences (WSSSPE1,
\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/WSSSPE1}) was held on
Sunday, 17 November 2013, in conjunction with the 2013 International
Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and
Analysis (SC13, \url{http://sc13.supercomputing.org}).

Because progress in scientific research is dependent on the quality
and accessibility of software at all levels, it is now critical to
address many challenges related to the development, deployment, and
maintenance of reusable software. In addition, it is essential that
scientists, researchers, and students are able to learn and adopt
software-related skills and methodologies. Established researchers are
already acquiring some of these skills, and in particular a
specialized class of software developers is emerging in academic
environments who are an integral and embedded part of successful
research teams. The WSSSPE workshop was intended to provide a forum
for discussion of the challenges, including both positions and
experiences.  The short papers and discussion have been archived to
provide a basis for continued discussion, and the workshop has fed
into the collaborative writing of this journal publication.
Additional papers based on extended versions of workshop submissions
are expected.  The level of interest in the workshop has led the
organizers, working with some of the submitters and attendees, to plan
two additional workshops (at the 2014 SciPy and SC conferences) and to
turn the workshop website into a community website that can be used as
a focus for further discussion and progress.  A minisymposium on
``Reliable Computational Science'' that aims to further explore some
of the key issues raised in WSSSPE is co-organized by a participant in
the 2014 SIAM Annual Meeting.

Before the WSSSPE1 workshop took place, the organizers self-published
a paper~\cite{WSSSPE1-pre-report} to document the process of
organizing and advertising the workshop, collecting and reviewing the
papers, and putting together the agenda.  Section~\ref{sec:process} is
based on that paper.  The remainder of this paper is based on the
workshop itself, as documented in a set of collaborative notes taken
during the workshop~\cite{WSSSPE1-google-notes}, including discussion
about the keynote presentations (\S\ref{sec:keynotes}), the three
panels (\S\ref{sec:devel}-\ref{sec:community}), other discussion
(\S\ref{sec:other}), cross-cutting issues (\S\ref{sec:cross-cutting}),
use cases (\S\ref{sec:use-cases}), and conclusions
(\S\ref{sec:conclusions}).

\todo{Mention somewhere statistics of participants: There were 140 seats, I (Katz) think 149 people at the first keynote, and about 90 at the end of the workshop.  They (SC13) counted people in the room 4 times during the day.  But I don’t know how many unique people attended, which I agree they should know.}

\section{Workshop Process and Agenda} \label{sec:process}

WSSSPE1 was organized in collaboration of the relatively small group
of five organizers and a larger peer-review committee with 36
members. This committee had early influence on the organization, e.g.,
on the specific call for papers.

The workshop call for papers included:

\begin{quote}
In practice, scientific software activities are part of an ecosystem
where key roles are held by developers, users, and funders. All three
groups supply resources to the ecosystem, as well as requirements that
bound it. Roughly following the example of NSF's Vision and Strategy
for Software
(\url{http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf12113})~\cite{NSF_software_vision},
the ecosystem may be viewed as having challenges related to:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.2in]
\item the development process that leads to new (versions of) software
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.2in]
\item how fundamental research in computer science or
  science/engineering domains is turned into reusable software
\item software created as a by-product of research
\item impact of computer science research on the development of
  scientific software
\end{itemize}
\item the support and maintenance of existing software, including
  software engineering
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.2in]
\item governance, business, and sustainability models
\item the role of community software repositories, their operation and
  sustainability
\end{itemize}
\item the role of open source communities or industry
\item use of the software
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.2in]
\item growing communities
\item reproducibility, transparency needs that may be unique to science
\end{itemize}
\item policy issues, such as
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.2in]
\item measuring usage and impact
\item software credit, attribution, incentive, and reward
\item career paths for developers and institutional roles
\item issues related to multiple organizations and multiple countries,
  such as intellectual property, licensing, etc.
\item mechanisms and venues for publishing software, and the role of
  publishers
\end{itemize}
\item education and training
\end{itemize}

\end{quote}

Based on the goal of encouraging a wide range of submissions from
those involved in software practice, ranging from initial thoughts and
partial studies to mature deployments, the organizers wanted to make
submission as easy as possible. The call for papers stated:

\begin{quote}
We invite short (4-page) position/experience reports that will be used
to organize panel and discussion sessions. These papers will be
archived by a third-party service, and provided DOIs. We encourage
submitters to license their papers under a Creative Commons license
that encourages sharing and remixing, as we will combine ideas (with
attribution) into the outcomes of the workshop.  An interactive site
will be created to link these papers and the workshop discussion, with
options for later comments and contributions. Contributions will be
peer-reviewed for relevance and originality before the links are added
to the workshop site; contributions will also be used to determine
discussion topics and panelists. We will also plan one or more papers
to be collaboratively developed by the contributors, based on the
panels and discussions.
\end{quote}

58 submissions were received, and almost all submitters used either
arXiv~\cite{arXiv-web} or figshare~\cite{figshare-web} to self-publish
their papers.

A peer review process followed the submissions, where
the 58 papers received 181 reviews, an average of 3.12 reviews per
paper. Reviews were completed using a Google form, which allowed
reviewers to choose papers they wanted to review, then to provide
general comments and scores on relevance to the organizers and
to the authors. The review reports enabled the organizers to decide
which papers to associate with the workshop, and allowed the authors
to improve their papers.

The organizers decided to list 54 of the papers as significant
contributions to the workshop, a very high acceptance rate, but one
that is reasonable, given the goal of broad participation and the fact
that the reports were already self-published. The papers were
grouped into three main categories, namely \emph{Developing and
Supporting Software}, \emph{Policy}, and \emph{Communities}. Each
subject area was associated with a panel and discussion at the
workshop.

The workshop itself consisted of two keynote presentations and the
three panels/discussion sessions. The panels were organized based on a
classification of the workshop submissions into three categories,
following the themes of the call for papers as modified by the areas
of the submissions. Three to four representatives from each submission
category were appointed as panelists, and assigned to read a subset of
the paper in that category and then discuss them in the panel.


\section{Keynotes\note{lead: Sou-Cheng (Terrya) Choi}} \label{sec:keynotes}

The WSSSPE1 workshop began with two keynote presentations.

\todo{section should include what was presented and what was discussed}

\todo{change references to papers or presentations to cites}

\subsection{A recipe for sustainable software, Philip E. Bourne.}

The first
keynote~\cite{WSSSPE1-keynote1}
was delivered by Philip E. Bourne of University of California, San Diego.  Bourne is a basic biomedical scientist but has formed four software
companies. He also helped found PLOS and
PDB~\cite{PDB}.  He is
working on automating three-dimensional visualizations of cell
contents and molecular structures, a problem that has not been solved
and would serve as a key function of software in biomedical sciences.

Bourne's keynote presentation is entiled ``A Recipe for Sustainable Software''.
He emphasized that sustainability for software ``does not just
mean more money from Government.''  He noted that in places,
development in science has improved thanks to open source and Github,
but for the most part remains arcane. He argued that there is much we
can learn from the App Store model. He mentioned
BioJava\footnote{\url{http://biojava.org/wiki/Main_Page}} and
OpenScienceDataCloud\footnote{\url{https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/}}
as distribution channels.  On a related note, Bourne observed a common
evolutionary pathway for computational biology projects, from data
archive to analytics platform to educational use, and suggested that
use of scientific software for outreach might be the final step.

Bourne shared with the audience a few real challenges he
encountered. First, he has looked into reproducibility in
computational biology, and has concluded that ``I have proved I cannot
reproduce research from my own lab''~\cite{Veretnik}.

Another problem he experienced was staff retention with respect to
private organizations which reward those combining research and
software expertise (the ``Google Bus''). However, he is a strong fan
of private sector sustainability sources and public-private
partnerships. He noted that making a successful business from
scientific software alone is very rare: founders overvalue while
customers undervalue. He noted that to last, an open source project
needs a minimal funding requirement even with a vibrant community --
good will only goes so far if you are being paid to do something else.
He talked about grant schemes of relevance in the U.S., particularly
with regard to technology
transfer.\footnote{\url{http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf09_1/gpg_2.jsp\#IID2}} \footnote{\url{http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/}}

He also had problems with selling research software: the technology
transfer office in his university wanted huge IP reachthrough, whereby
they would get a share of profits from drugs developed by pharma
companies who use the software. He was aware this was unrealistic but
the technology transfer office insisted for a while. He wants to push
a one-click approach to purchasing university-written software.

He then presented the usual arguments on directly valuing software as a
research output alongside papers. Readers will be familiar with this
debate. An interesting reference here is ``What
does peer review mean when applied to computer code?, Rosemary Dickin.''
\footnote{\url{http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2013/08/08/what-does-peer-review-mean-when-applied-to-computer-code/}}

On the idea of the \textbf{digital enterprise}, where
IT underpins the whole of organizational activities, he contended that
universities are way behind the curve on this. In particular, he
highlighted the separation of research, teaching and administration into
silos without a common IT framework as a blocker to many useful
organizational innovations: ``University 2.0 is yet to happen.'' He
spoke of a circumstance where someone had used an algorithm developed
for computational biology in marketing.

The role of an institution is important in this space. He argued that
funders can help train institutions not just individuals.

He concluded with a reference to his paper~\cite{bourne_ten} and
argued that computational scientists ``have a responsibility to
convince their institutions and communities that software is
scholarship,'' a point with which we strongly agree.

\subsection{Scientific Software and the Open Collaborative Web, Arfon Smith}


The second keynote~\cite{WSSSPE1-keynote2} was delivered by
 Arfon Smith of GitHub.

His talk used an example from data reduction in Astronomy, where he
needed to remove interfering effects from the device. He built a ``bad
pixel mask'', and realized that while this is persistent, there was no
way/practice of sharing this with the data, so many researchers
repeated the same calculations. He estimated that 13 person-years were
wasted in this redundant calculation.

He asked, of this practice, ``why didn't we know better?'' and argued
this was because we were taught to focus on immediate research
outcomes and not on continuously improving and building on tools for
research. He then asked, later in our working lives, when we do know
better, why don't we act any different, and argued this was due to
incentives and their lack: only the immediate products of research,
not the software, are valued.  He referenced Victoria Stodden's talk
at
OKCon\footnote{\url{http://okcon.org/main-speakers/victoria-stodden/}},\footnote{\url{http://www.stanford.edu/~vcs/talks/OKcon2013-Sept172013-STODDEN.pdf}}
which he said argued these points well.

He cited the EMCEE\footnote{\url{https://github.com/dfm/emcee}} Markov
Chain Monte Carlo code by Dan Forman
Mackey\footnote{\url{http://dan.iel.fm/}} and Joe
Zuntz\footnote{\url{http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~zuntz/Joe_Zuntz/Welcome.html}}
as good examples of scientific projects using GitHub.

C. Titus Brown\footnote{\url{http://ged.msu.edu/}} argues that with
regard to reusable software, ``we should just start doing it.'' Arfon
noted that documentation should be ``treated as a first class
entity.''  He noted that some software fields have excellent cultures
of module reuse, such as
rubygems\footnote{\url{http://rubygems.org/}},
PyPI\footnote{\url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi}}, and
CPAN\footnote{\url{http://www.cpan.org/}}, where there is effectively
ultra-low-friction collaboration through these repositories. This has
not happened in highly numerical, compiled language scientific
software.

He argued that the GitHub Pull Request code review mechanism facilitates
such collaboration, by allowing one to code first, and seek review and a
merge back into the trunk later.

Fernando Perez says that ``Open Source is reproducible by necessity''
- since reproducibility is a prerequisite for remote collaboration.
Arfon therefore defined GitHub as part of the next stage in
development of the web, following on from the ``social web'' of
Facebook et.al.: ``The Collaborative Web.''

\subsection{Research or Reuse?}

Discussion of software produced as a by-product versus software
developed for reuse. How does this change the project, who develops
the code, growth beyond 1--2 person projects to larger projects with
diverse set of consumers and contributors. Modular and extensible code
versus working for current research problem---tackled by same people,
or a collaborative team?

\subsection{Defining Sustainability for Scientific Software}

What is sustainable? What are the best practices, can workshops fund
meetings to help define and improve best practices in these areas?
Software plans from the funding agencies? This topic is expanded upon
in \S\ref{sec:cross-cutting}, since it was discussed up in multiple
parts of the WSSSPE1 workshop.

\subsection{Training Scientists to Develop and Support Software}

Discussion of the evolving role of scientists, and/or others that fill
these roles.

\subsection{Software Process, Code Review, Automation, Reproducibility}

There are a lot of tools out there, but few are currently used. Look
at what some projects have found successful, and how to automate as
much as possible to reduce additional overhead.

\subsection{Software and Data Licensing}

Its impact on how and where research products are used, who can
collaborate and what patterns have worked/not worked in existing
communities.

\subsection{Funding, Sustainability Beyond the First Grant/Institution}

How initial software development is funded, moving to follow up
projects, maintenance, community growth, collaborating with other
institutions, labs, industry, internationally. Contract relationship
versus collaborative development between scientists and software
developers.

\subsection{Training Others to use Software}

Who creates training materials, how are they distributed, integration
into courses when projects see very wide application in research.

\todo{section should include what was presented and what was discussed}

There were a number of papers categorized under the Communities banner and so two presenters each summarized half of the submissions in this area.

\subsection{Communities Part 1}

This collection of papers was summarized by Karen Cranston.

\subsection{Communities Part 2}

Nancy Wilkins-Diehr summarized 6 papers in "Communities Part 2". The Christopherson paper outlines the degree to which research
relies on high quality software. There are often barriers and a lack of suitable incentives for researchers to embrace software engineering principals.
The Water Science Software Institute is working to lower some of these barriers through an Open Community Engagement Process.
This is a 4-step iterative development process that incorporates Agile development principals.

\begin{itemize}

\item Step 1 - Design - thorough discussion of research questions
\item Step 2 - Develop working code
\item Step 3 - Refine based on new requirements
\item Step 4 - Publish open source

\end{itemize}

The Christopherson paper reports on the application of Steps 1-3 to a computational modeling framework developed in the 1990s.
Step 1 was realized as a 2-day, in person specifications meeting and code walk-through. Step 2 was a 5-day hack-athon to develop working code.
Step 3 was a 3-day hack-a-thon to refine the code based on new requirements. The team worked on small, low-risk unit of 
code. It was challenging, revealed unanticipated obstacles, programmers had to work together, and experimentation was encouraged.

The paper summarized recommendations to others wishing to engage in this or a similar process. Start small and gradually 
build toward more complex objectives. This is consistent with Agile development. Refactor before adding new functionality.
Approach development as a learning experience. Welcome experimentation, and treat mistakes as a natural part of the learning process.
Repeat Step 1 activities before all hackathons to develop consensus before coding. This allows coding to be the focus of subsequent hackathons. 
In higher risk situations, provide additional time for Step 1 activities. The Christopherson team recommends a minimum of two months.
Ensure any newcomers receive some form of orientation prior to the hackathon, such as a code walkthrough or system documentation.
Co-locate rather than collaborating remotely whenever feasible.

The Pierce paper described how science gateways can provide a user-friendly entry to complex cyberinfrastructure. The paper opens with a description of the explosion of use of just a few gateways. 
Over 3.5 years, more than 7,000 biologists have run phylogenetic codes on supercomputers using the CIPRES Science Gateway. In 1 year, over 120 scientists from 50 institutions used the UltraScan Science Gateway, 
increasing the sophistication of analytical ultracentrifugation experiments worldwide. The new Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) registered 100+ 
users who used 250,000 CPU hours in only a few months.

Gateways, however, need to keep operational costs low and can often make use of common components. Science Gateway Platform as a Service (Sci-GaP)
delivers middleware as a hosted, scalable third-party service while domain developers focus on user interfaces and domain-specific data in the gateway.
The middleware handles things like authentication, application installation and reliable execution and help desk support.

One key to SciGaP is its openness. While based on Apache Airavata project and the CIPRES Workbench Framework, community contributions are encouraged because of its open source, open governance and open operations policies.
The goal is robust, sustainable infrastructure with a cycle of development that improves reliability and prioritizes
stakeholder requirements. The project is leveraging Internet2's Net+ mechanisms for converting SciGaP and its gateways into commodity services.

The Zentner paper describes experiences and challenges with the large nanoHUB.org community. They define community as 
a ``body of persons of common and especially professional interests scattered through a larger society.'' This makes support
challenging because of the diversity of viewpoints and needs. The group constantly examines its policies to determine
whether they are indirectly alienating part of the community or encouraging particular types of use.

nanoHUB's 10-year history with over 260,000 users annually provides a lot of data to analyze. 4000 resources contributed by
1000 authors. nanoHUB serves both the research and education community and the contribution model allows researchers to get
their codes out into the community and in use in education very rapidly. The primary software challenges are twofold - support
for the HUBzero framework and challenges related to the software contributed by the community.

The group has learned that community contributions are maximized with a tolerant licensing approach. HUBzero uses an 
LGPLv3 license so contributors can create unique components and license as they choose. If they make changes to source 
code, the original license must be maintained for redistribution. As far as contributed resources, these must be open access,
but not necessarily open source. This allows contributors to meet the requirements of their institutions and funding agencies.
Quality is maintained via user ratings. Documentation is encouraged and nanoHUB supplies regression test capabilities, but 
the user community provides ratings, poses questions and contributes to wishlists and citation counts - all of which incentivize
code authors.

The Terrel paper describes support for the Python scientific community through two major efforts - the SciPy conference and the
NumFOCUS foundation. Reliance on software in science has driven a huge demand for development, but this development is typically done as a side effort
and often in a rush to publish without documentation and testing.
While created by academics, software support often falls to industrial institutions. SciPy brings together industry, government, 
and academics to share their code and experience in an open environment. 

NumFOCUS promotes open, usable scientific software while sustaining the community. Specific activities include educational programs, 
collaborative research tools and documentation and 
promotion of high-level languages, reproducible scientific research, and open-code development.
Governance of the non-profit is a loose grantor-grantee relationship with projects allowing for monies to be placed in the groups accounts.
This has raised money to hire developers for open code development, maintain testing machines, organize the PyData conference series, and sponsor community members to attend conferences.

Software sustainability relies on contributions from all sectors of user community. Together SciPy and NumFOCUS support these sectors. By maximizing contributions growing the user base they help develop and mature Python.

The L\"{o}ffler paper describes the Cactus project which was started in 1996 by participants in USA Binary Black Hole Alliance 
Challenge. Cactus has a flesh and thorns model - a community-oriented framework that allows researchers to easily work 
together with reusable and extendable software elements. Modules are compiled into an executable and can remain dormant, becoming
active only when parameters and simulation data dictate. Users can  use modules written by others or can write their own 
modules without changing other code. The community has grown and diversified beyond the original science areas.

The paper points out 4 keys to sustaining the community - modular design, growing a collaborative community, career paths and credit.
In modular design, the Cactus project went far beyond standard practices of APIs. 
Domain specific languages (DSLs) allow decoupling of components - for example I/O, mesh refinement, PAPI counters, and
boundary conditions abstracted from science code. In academia, publications are the main currency of credit. Because the 
project connects code developments to science, the work is 
publishable and modules are citable. Because of the open source, modular approach, programmers can see the impact of their contributions and often continue
work after graduation. Career paths remain a challenge, however. Tasks that are essential from a software engineering perspective
are often not rewarded in academia. The best programmers in a science environment often have multidisciplinary expertise.
That also is not rewarded in academia.

The Wilkins-Diehr paper describes an NSF software institute effort to build a community of those creating science gateways or
web portals for science. These gateways, as described in some of the other papers in this section, can be quite capable, having a 
remarkable impact on science. 

This paper mentioned challenges highlighted by other papers in this section - mainly the conflict between funding for research
vs infrastructure and the challenges around getting academic credit for infrastructure. Because the authors have studied
many projects, they've also observed how development is often done in an isolated hobbyist environment. Developers are unable
to take advantage of similar work done by others. isolation even when projects have common needs.
But often projects struggle for sustainable funding because they provide infrastructure to conduct
research and many times only the research is funded. Gateways also may start as small group research project, taking off in popularity
once they go live without any long term plans for sustainability or without resources in the project to plan for such.
Subsequent disruptions in service can limit effectiveness and test the limits of the research community's trust. The impact
of gateways can be increased substantially if we understand what makes them successful.

Recommendations from an early study of successful gateways include the following. Leadership and management teams should 
design governance to represent multiple strengths and perspectives, plan for change and turnover in the future, 
recruit a development team that understands both the technical and domain-related issues, consider sustainability and measure success early and often.
Successful projects recognize the benefits and costs of hiring a team of professionals, demonstrate credibility through stability and 
clarity of purpose, leverage the work of others and plan for flexibility.
Successful projects identify an existing community and understand that communities' needs before beginning. Projects adapt
as the communities' needs evolve. For funders, the lifecycle of technology projects must be considered. Solicitations should
be designed to reward effective planning, recognize the benefits and limitations of both technology innovation and reuse,
expect adjustments during the production process, copy effective models from other industries and sectors, and encourage partnerships that support gateway sustainability.


Through a business incubator type approach, the institute plans to provide a variety of services that could be shared amongst
projects. Consultation and resources on topics such as business plan development, software engineering practices, 
software licensing options, usability, security and project management as well as a software repository and hosting 
service will be available. Experts will be available for multi-month assignments to help research teams build their own gateways,
teaching them how to maintain and add to the work after the collaboration ends. Forums, symposia and an annual conference
will connect members of the development community. A modular, layered framework that supports community contributions and 
allows developers to choose components will be delivered and finally 
workforce development activities will help train the next generation for careers in this cross- disciplinary area and 
build pools of institutional expertise that many projects can leverage. Shared services and forums can dramatically reduce the cost
of building and sustaining gateways. Workforce development can encourage technology professionals to remain in the sciences.

\section{Cross-cutting Issue: Defining Sustainability}  \label{sec:cross-cutting}

\note{lead: Daniel S. Katz}

The question of what was meant by ``sustainability'' in the context of software
came up in many different parts of the workshop, specifically in one of the
keynotes, the Developing and Maintaining Software panel, and the Policy panel.

In his keynote, Phil Bourne suggested that perhaps sustainability can be defined
as the effort that happens to make the essential things continue. This leads to
having to decide what it is that we want to sustain, if what we want to sustain is
valuable, and finally, who would care if it went away, and how does one measure
how much they care.

In the Developing and Maintaining Software panel, there was some discussion
on this topic: what does sustainability mean? It was pointed out that
OSS Watch proposes a Software Sustainability Maturity Model to address
the issue of how sustainability a particular element of software is, and says
that this sustainability is important. ``When choosing
software for procurement or development reuse - regardless of the
license and development model you will use - you need to consider
the future. While a software product may satisfy today's needs, will
it satisfy tomorrow's needs? Will the supplier still be around in
five years' time? Will the supplier still care for all its customers
in five years' time? Will the supplier be responsive to bug reports
and feature requests? In other words, is the software sustainable?''~\cite{OSS-ssmm-web}

Attendees suggested that a key question that the definition of sustainability is
one issue on which the community needs to agree, and that ideally, an initial
definition would be determined during the workshop, or at least some progress
would be made towards this goal.  Another topic that came up is what the
goal of sustainability is.  Perhaps it's reproducible science, or
persistence, or quality, or something else.  Similarly, some attendees want
to understand how success in sustainability is measured.  How does a set of
developers know when they have actually achieved sustainable software?
This led to a comment that sustainability should be addressed throughout the
full software life cycle.

Another topic that came up during the Developing and Maintaining Software
panel is the relationship of sustainability to other software attributes.  Attendees
asked ``what is the relationship between sustainability and provenance?'' And,
``is usability separate from sustainability or a fundamental part of it?''

In addition, the Policy panel had a large amount of discussion about
defining sustainability, as one of the subtopics in that panel was
Modeling Sustainability, and modeling requires defining what will be modeled.

In this subtopic, two papers included discussion of the definition of
sustainability.  Venters et al.~\cite{Venters_WSSSPE} mentioned
that this is a rather ambiguous concept, and that the lack of an accepted
definition gets in the way of integrating the concept into software engineering.
They suggest that sustainability is a non-functional requirement, and that the
quality of software architectures determines sustainability.  They then
propose that sustainability is a measure of a set of central quality attributes:
extensibility, interoperability, maintainability, portability, reusability, and scalability.
Finally, they develop an architecture evaluation framework based on scenarios
that helps to illuminate how to measure quality/sustainability at
the architectural level.

Katz and Proctor~\cite{Katz_WSSSPE} included a set of questions that could
be used to measure software sustainability, and though these questions might falsely lead
to yes or no answers, the complete set would determine a range of values for
sustainability. These question are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Will the software continue to provide the same functionality in the future, even if the environment (other parts of the infrastructure) changes?
\item Is the functionality and usability clearly explained to new users? Do users have a mechanism to ask questions and to learn about the element?
\item Will the functionality be correct in the future, even if the environment changes?
\item Does it provide the functionality that existing and future users want?
\item Does it incorporate new science/theory/tools as they develop?
\end{itemize}

\section{Illustrative Use Cases} \label{sec:use-cases}

\note{lead: Ketan Maheshwari, contributors: Andy Terrel}

Following is a list of software projects discussed throughout the workshop:

\begin{itemize}
    \item github
    \item mvapich
    \item Cactus
    \item visTrails
    \item MINRES/QLP
    \item SimGrid
    \item Swift
    \item Galaxy
    \item FastMath and package managers
    \item R/qtl
    \item OWL/RDF
    \item AMR/multiphysics
    \item DUNE
    \item PAAS
    \item Gateways
    \item Globus-Genomics
\end{itemize}

In this section, we discuss the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Categorize the real-world software projects into workshop themes. This is based on the aspect of a software project that dominates and best fits one of the workshop themes.
    \item Discuss how the theme has impacted software projects over its lifetime.
    \item Discuss similarities and differences between these projects.
    \item What is a takeaway for a new project? What are the lessons learned? How can the course of current and future development projects be altered to implement lessons learned.
\end{itemize}

\note{Dan: do we need this section?  I think there's some overlap
  between this and the discussion in the Developing and Support
  Software section.  Or perhaps this should go in the cross-cutting
  issues section?  Let's write it down here - then we can decide if it goes elsewhere}
\note{Ketan: yes, may be this section will split and merge into other sections}

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}


\todo{pull the discussion together}

\todo{add some analysis of the deficiencies and difficulties that are
  present in different fields, and those that are common?}

\todo{say something about licensing - lessons, advice, etc.?}

\subsection{Recommendations or Lessons}

\note{if needed.}

\subsection{Follow up actions}

\note{or at least the discussion about them, and the current plans for
  future events.}

\note{conclusions from pre-workshop paper follows}

The WSSSPE workshop has begun an experiment in how we can
collaboratively build a workshop agenda. However, contributors also
want to get credit for their participation in the process. And the
workshop organizers want to make sure that the workshop content and
their efforts are recorded.  Ideally, there would be a service that
would be able to index the contributions to the workshop, serving the
authors, the organizers, and the larger community. But since there
isn't such a service today, the workshop organizers are writing this
initial report and making use of arXiv as a partial solution to
provide a record of the workshop.

After the workshop, one or more additional papers will be created that
will include the discussions at the workshop. These papers will likely
have many authors, and may be submitted to peer-reviewed journals.
